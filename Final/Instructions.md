#Instructions

##Python packages
You can start downloading these immediately, even before the exam.
You will need these libraries (win32-py2.7 versions):
pytz: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pytz
gdal: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal
six: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#six
fiona: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona

You can optionally use this library for Problem 1 (it is easier than other options):
requests: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#requests

##Exam
Aster will provide you with a dropbox link to a zip file. She may also place the materials on the shared drive.  
  
Unzip the zip file onto the C drive so that all contents are contained in C:\final and not in C:\final\final.  
Open C:\final\final.py, using whatever editor you wish.  

final.py contains 9 incomplete functions, named func1.py to func9.py. Do not modify any code below the comment box explaining problem 10.  
  
You should be able to work on any of the functions without completing previous functions. The main program will switch to intermediate inputs if previous functions fail or are incomplete.  
  
Pay attention to the notes provided with each function as well as the doc strings, these are critical to solving the problem. Remember to delete out the "pass" in an empty function once you write the function.  
  
For the last question, you are provided a skeleton html file, leafletmap.html.  
Complete this file as instructed within it.  
  
final.py and leafletmap.html should both be submitted to your personal github repository. You can host the html file on your github.io site for testing, but must also submit it to your repository.  
  
Ask Aster if you have any questions.  
Good luck!
