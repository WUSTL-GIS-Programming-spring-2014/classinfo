##Python packages  
You can start downloading these immediately, even before the exam.  
  
You will need these libraries (win32-py2.7 versions):  
pytz: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pytz  
gdal: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal  
six: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#six  
fiona: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona  
  
You can optionally use this library for Problem 1 (it is easier than other options):

##Exam
Aster will provide you with a dropbox link to a zip file. She may also place the materials on the shared drive.  
  
Unzip the zip file onto the C drive so that all contents are contained in C:\final and not in C:\final\final.  
Open C:\final\final.py, using whatever editor you wish.  

final.py contains 9 incomplete functions, named func1.py to func9.py. Do not modify any code below the comment box explaining problem 10.  

The exam mostly increases in difficulty and time required for a question. Each question is 10 pts, with 10 pts for a complete answer and partial credit depending on how complete your logic is otherwise (be sure to use comments to demonstrate this).  Problem 7 is much more simple than its location in the exam, and problem 9 is relatively simple. You can do both of these before other questions.    
Problems 1, 2, and 3 are self-checking. The main() function will compare your output to the expected output for you.   Problems 4 through 9 have expected outputs in the ExpectedOutputs folder. You can use ArcMap or Notepad++ (for geojson) to compare your output with the expected outputs.  
There is no comparison output for problem 10.  
  
You should be able to work on any of the functions without completing previous functions. The main program will switch to intermediate inputs if previous functions fail or are incomplete.  
  
Pay attention to the notes provided with each function as well as the doc strings, these are critical to solving the problem. Remember to delete out the "pass" in an empty function once you write the function.  
  
For the last question, you are provided a skeleton html file, leafletmap.html.  
Complete this file as instructed within it.  
  
final.py and leafletmap.html should both be submitted to your personal github repository. You can host the html file on your github.io site for testing, but must also submit it to your repository.  
  
Ask Aster if you have any questions.  
Good luck!
